        In Western astrology, <strong>astrological signs </strong>are the twelve
        30 degree sectors that make up Earth's 360 degree orbit around the Sun.
        The signs enumerate from the first day of spring known as the First
        Point of Aries which is the vernal equinox. The <em>Western astrological signs</em>
        are <span class="specialText">Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio,
        Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces</span>. The Western zodiac
        originated in Babylonian astrology, and was later influenced by
        Hellenistic culture. Each sign was named after a constellation the sun
        annually moved through while crossing the sky. This observation is
        emphasized in the simplified and popular sun sign astrology.
