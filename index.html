            In Western astrology, <strong>astrological signs </strong>are the
            twelve 30 degree sectors that make up Earth's 360 degree orbit
            around the Sun. The signs enumerate from the first day of spring
            known as the First Point of Aries which is the vernal equinox. The
            <em>Western astrological signs</em> are
            <span class="specialText"
              >Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio,
              Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces</span
            >. The Western zodiac originated in Babylonian astrology, and was
            later influenced by Hellenistic culture. Each sign was named after a
            constellation the sun annually moved through while crossing the sky.
            This observation is emphasized in the simplified and popular sun
            sign astrology.
